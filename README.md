<b>SCENARIO</b>
<br/>
<br/>
After the homepage, a full-screen picture and a button link in the middle, the user can view all the campgrounds that are available in the database. He can select one, and acces more infos, like <i>price, comments, google map and description</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
To add some campground, you first have to register, with a simple name and password form, then you can <ul><li>create, edit, delete campgrounds</li><li>add, edit, delete comments</li></ul>
<i>You CANNOT perform edit and delete actions if you're not the owners of campgrounds or comments</i>
<br/>
